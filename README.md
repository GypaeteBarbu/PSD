"plan de sandage d√©terminantaux"

This project is to provide tools in several programming languages to find kernels that best minimize the objective function.  
For more information there is a documentation.

## to get started

### PYTHON
To use the program with the manopt method, it is neccessary in the progpymanopt file to change the variable Pi and X and r in the "if __name__ == '__main__'". Pi must be of type numpy dim-1 and X must be of type numpy dim-2 and r must be of type int or float.

### MATLAB
To use the program with the manopt method, it is neccessary in the progmanopt file to change the variable Pi and X and r. Pi must be of real column vector and X must be of real matrice and r must be of type int or float.  
To use the program with the rotation method, it is neccessary in the progrotation file to change the variable K and X. K must be of real or imaginary matrix and X must be of real matrice.  
To use the program with the penlab method, it is neccessary in the progpenlab file to change the variable K and X. K must be of real matrix and and Pi real column vector and X must be of real matrice.  

disclamers the programs penlab runs but they do not give satisfactory results.

<!--**[python](https://www.python.org/)** version 3.5 +-->
- [[shields](http://img.shields.io/badges/python-3.5+-brightgreen.svg)](https://shields.io/)
the use of program progmanopt requires :  

- pandas  
- autograd 1.4  
- pymanopt 2.0  
- pytorch  
- tensorflow to be continued

### MATLAB

<!--**[matlab](https://fr.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)** version R2018b +-->
- [[shields](http://img.shields.io/badges/matlab-r2018b-brightgreen.svg)](https://shields.io/)

the use of program progpenlab requires the installation of the package [[shield](http://img.shields.io/badges/penlab-1.04-brightgreen.svg)](https://shields.io/).  
the use of program progmanopt requires the installation of the package [[shield](http://img.shields.io/badges/manopt-7.0.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://shields.io/).
